# pipex
**Why on earth would I need pipes ?**

The goal of this project is to reproduce the behavior of this bash function : 
```bash
cmd1 < input_file | cdm2 > output file
```

For me, it's the first really tricky project. It is really hard to debug by hand because of the different processes you create.
